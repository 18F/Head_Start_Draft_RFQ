# Head_Start_Draft_RFQ
Landing Place for all things vendors will need to know about the draft RFQ we're working on with Head Start. Note this is still a Work in Progress and the draft RFQ isn't quite ready for release, yet. When we're ready for release, we'll follow a similar process to the one we used for [TANF.](https://github.com/18F/tdrs-app-rfq). For more insights into the prototyping work 18F is doing as we help set the groundwork for a vendor to take on this work, see our [project repository.](https://github.com/18F/Head-Start-TTA). For more information on why we prototype prior to procurement, [our Forest Service team wrote up the importance of discovery research](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/06/22/why-discovery-research-matters-for-modular-procurement/) and we've also written up a blog about why it's [generally a good practice.](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/01/30/getting-prepared-to-prototype/)
