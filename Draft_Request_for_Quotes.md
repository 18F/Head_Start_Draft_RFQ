# 1.0 Background and Purpose

## 1.1	Background
Local Head Start programs prepare America’s most vulnerable young children, ages birth to 5, to succeed in school and in life. About 1,600 agencies across the country receive grant funding and oversight from the [Office of Head Start (OHS)](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/about-us/article/about-office-head-start) to operate local Head Start programs, which enroll about 1 million children each year. OHS ensures that grantees meet [federal standards](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/policy/45-cfr-chap-xiii) for operating safe and effective programs. 

Head Start was launched as a federal pilot program in 1965 and has a powerful track record of innovation [and effectiveness](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/story) in early childhood education. More than 37 million Americans have attended Head Start programs. 

Head Start programs deliver comprehensive services to children and families in core areas of early learning, health, and family well-being. Most programs operate in centers, though services can also be offered in family child care homes, an individual family's home, or locally designed options, such as inside a homeless shelter.

To help grantees deliver high-quality services, OHS is legislatively mandated and funded to provide a training and technical assistance (TTA) system. TTA activities are planned and delivered at the national, regional and grantee levels; each level has a distinct function designed to complement the others. For a detailed explanation of how the TTA system operates, see [this page.](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/assistance) 

Examples of TTA include, but are not limited to, the following: 

* Individual TTA: In-person or virtual meetings where a single grantee and TTA provider address a specific issue, such as helping a staff person set up a coaching program to support teachers and improve the quality of instruction. The TTA objective could be completed in a single session or extend over several engagements. 

* Group TTA: In-person, virtual sessions or a combination where several grantees address a common issue, such as serving the needs of families affected by opioid misuse. 

## 1.2	Problems OHS is looking to address 

As noted above, TTA activities are planned and delivered at the federal, regional and local grantee levels. However, while there is multiple points of data capture, there is no centralized data system for TTA leaders in Central Office and 12 Regions, their contractors, or grantees to share information about myriad TTA needs, activities or outcomes. Various streams of TTA data are: 

1. housed in a comprehensive Central Office system that was not designed for TTA task management; 
2. housed in a limited legacy system that won’t meet federal IT standards; 
3. held in stand-alone systems managed by regional contractors; and 
4. held in non-standardized documents held by individuals at various levels of the system. 

These information silos make it difficult for OHS TTA leaders to:

* ensure that TTA is data-driven, responsive to grantee needs and effective; and
* provide real-time oversight and quality assurance of the 12 regional TTA  contracts and 4 national TTA cooperative agreements.

### Narrative and Anecdotal Information 

Regional TTA contractors must complete TTA Activity Reports, which contain abundant narrative data. Text-heavy narrative data can be helpful but it is hard to compare or track over time. People may also overlook the value of narrative data or choose other sources, such as anecdotal information, because trying to decipher a lot of text is overwhelming and frustrating. 

### Disconnected Systems

TTA requests, reports and other data are housed in disparate systems that often weren’t built for managing comprehensive TTA tasks. Some are OHS-controlled, others are independent. Extracting and comparing data across these systems is difficult and time-consuming. There is a lack of consistency in solutions and systems at all levels (Central Office, Regional Offices, TTA contractors, states, and grantees).  

### Data Access

Different systems require different credentials and have restricted access for different users, which don’t always reflect user needs. Existing data can be difficult to access. 

### Data Inconsistency

Across TTA Activity Reports, email TTA summaries and official correspondence, people may use inconsistent terms to describe issues they are working on. Different TTA contracts may also adapt federal forms and gather differently labeled information, making it harder to collapse information and identify trends.

### Data Usability
TTA Activity Reports are rich in information but are not formatted to summarize meaningful information. Information is also contained in uploaded attachments that aren’t searchable.

It is also difficult to organize and compare meaningful grant-level TTA data across grantees, or to track an individual grantee’s TTA history because grant numbers change when a grantee receives new funding. 

### Incomplete View of TTA Activities

While national TTA centers and regional TTA contracts offer many forms of TTA, grantees also purchase TTA services directly from many vendors. Grantees receive 50% of the federal TTA appropriation for this use, but their TTA purchases are not easily analyzable at the regional or national level for coordinated TTA planning. This creates a further blind spot in understanding grantee needs and trends, and in ensuring that national and regional TTA providers fully understand grantee needs. 

### *NOTE:* OHS acknowledges that not all of these problems can be addressed in the scope and period of performance of this task order. This information is provided so that the contractor is aware of the context of the work being done as the OHS Product Owner prioritizes the modular software development activities of the contractor team.

# 2.0 Scope

## Description of Work to be Performed

OHS seeks agile software development services. The services to be provided will include all aspects of the software development process, including initial planning, design, software development and coding, prototyping, documentation, testing, and configuration.

OHS intends that the software delivered under this task order will be committed to the public domain. The Contractor will have to obtain OHS permission before developing software under this task order that incorporates any software that is not free and open source. The Contractor must post all developed code to a GitHub repository designated by OHS. 

This software development project will use agile development principles, with robust documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible infrastructure. OHS expects that the development process will be collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent communication between OHS and the Contractor. 

The contractor team will be incrementally building a comprehensive TTA Data Platform (TTADP) that collects information from the entire TTA process and provides real-time, accessible information on TTA needs and activities. The initial phases of the development process will focus on reporting on the TTA Activities that are being delivered by TTA contractors and used by various groups within the Head Start system for management and ongoing decision making. 

By aggregating information around key data questions while meeting the needs of users inputting and reviewing the TTA data, the TTADP will greatly improve oversight, so leaders can ensure that TTA is responsive to grantee needs, meeting expectations for continuous quality improvement, and producing desired outcomes.

OHS has designated an empowered Product Owner for this project. OHS Product Owner will set direction, make prioritization choices to build a product roadmap, consider and address the business needs of OHS, and support the other members of the development team. The Contractor will assist OHS with product management and facilitation.

OHS, not the Contractor, will be responsible for the hosting of the deployed TTADP and obtaining any necessary Authority to Operate (ATO). OHS will also determine what security controls are required and whether they have been satisfied. OHS expects to provide those security controls to the Contractor as either acceptance criteria or separate user stories. The Contractor is expected to use best practices for security and compliance in writing, testing, and delivering code.

OHS intends to deploy the new TTADP as soon as the software has been sufficiently developed to provide the minimal viable functionality required to support an acceptable level of OHS’s fundamental TTA operations.

## 2.1	Product Vision
The OHS team has established the following as the overall vision statement for the TTADP. All prioritization decisions by the Product Owner will take this vision into consideration over the course of task order performance: 

**_To better serve children and families in Head Start programs, the TTA Data Platform will help staff at all levels make data-informed decisions that continuously improve Head Start services._**

## 2.2	Anticipated Period of Performance, Budget, and Ceiling Price

Vendors are expected to propose assuming a budget of $1.5M for the base year and $1.5M for each of the two option years. The not-to-exceed-ceiling on this contract over the course of three years will be $8M (not inclusive of Government’s use of FAR 52.217-8, if needed). The ceiling price is set higher than the budget amount to allow for the government to add funding in case the vendor team should need to add resources to meet the priorities set by the government’s Product Owner.

# 3.0 Objectives

## 3.1	MVP and Epic Stories

The MVP and Epic Stories set forth below will be the starting point for the development of software to be provided under this task order. These preliminary stories are provided only for illustrative purposes, and do not comprise the full scope or detail of the project. OHS expects that the Contractor will work closely with the Product Owner to perform regular user research and usability testing and to develop and prioritize a full gamut of user stories as the project progresses.

### TTA Data Product MVP

The MVP is a part, but not the full realization, of the product vision. If the Product Vision is the manifestation of a fully decorated, multi-layered cake, then the MVP is a single layer of the cake. It is a single layer of the cake, and only part of the larger vision.

REMINDER TO PULL IN CAKE ILLUSTRATION

An MVP focused on Regional Office Program Specialists (PS) is an opportunity to digitize the TTA request process. The current state of TTA data does not capture information in a single location with enough relevant details to efficiently support PS users in their roles.

PS users will be able to initiate TTA Requests and track their status through completion which combines TTA Activity Summaries, Next Steps, and Task Completion. This system will allow PS users to view TTA over time, for specific grantees and groups of grantees, and across specific topic areas. In addition, the PS users will be able to track progress over time and may connect other dashboard/management systems via API access. For more information, see our [MVP slide deck.](need this from Robert)

As a Regional Office (federal) TTA staff member, I would like to have a clear view of all TTA activities from request through completion so that I can know if activities are complete and meeting objectives.

### User Stories
Individual user stories may be modified, added, retracted, or reprioritized by OHS at any time, and OHS expects that the user stories will be continuously refined during the development process. 

## 3.2 List of Deliverables with Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

The following chart sets forth the performance standards and quality levels the code and documentation provided by the Contractor must meet, and the methods OHS will use to assess the standard and quality levels of that code and documentation.

| User Research | Usability testing and other user research methods must be conducted at regular intervals throughout the development process (not just at the beginning or end). | Research plans and artifacts from usability testing and/or other research methods with end users are available at the end of every applicable sprint, in accordance with the contractor’s research plan. | OFA will manually evaluate the artifacts based on a research plan provided by the contractor at the end of the second sprint and every applicable sprint thereafter. |

The government will use the (QASP) to monitor the quality of the Contractor’s performance. This oversight will help the government ensure that contractor performance reaches required levels throughout the contract term. The QASP provides the government with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance and provides the basis for performance ratings in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). The QASP may be updated by modification to the contract. The QASP provides the basis for performing and controlling the project’s activities in accordance with the contract.

# 4.0 Contract Place of Performance and Contract Type
The Contractor may choose the location(s) from which to perform the required software development services. 

The government intends to award a time and material (T&M) type contract. All rates shall be fully burdened and T&M rates are fixed at the time of award. The offeror must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each labor category applies to labor performed by— (1) The offeror; (2) Subcontractors; and/or (3) Divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates or the offeror under a common control.

The contractor shall understand that neither the funded ceiling on T&M CLINs, nor the hours on the T&M CLINs, is a guarantee to the contractor. The Government will utilize the hours and funding required to meet the Government’s need.

# 5.0 Operating Constraints (Non-functional Requirements)

## 5.1	Environment
The System will be deployed to cloud.gov infrastructure provided by OHS. Deployments are automated via continuous integration/continuous deployment. Contractor is required to maintain deployment scripts and configurations as changes are required. OHS will provide the necessary cloud.gov configuration information to the Contractor.

The system is composed of three primary parts: a database, a backend API application, and a frontend web application. All technology choices must work seamlessly with cloud.gov hosting. Data files are written using either JSON or YAML, depending on who is expected to edit them. (e.g., data files that OHS may edit directly are written in YAML).

The backend API application should use technologies such as:

_ A modern, open-source friendly language such as Ruby or Javascript, on the most recent version, or most recent LTS version, if applicable.

_ An open-source framework such as Rails or Express, on the most recent version or most recent LTS version, if applicable.

_ The frontend web application should use technologies such as:

_ A modern, open-source friendly language such as Javascript or Typescript, on the most recent version, or most recent LTS version, if applicable.
