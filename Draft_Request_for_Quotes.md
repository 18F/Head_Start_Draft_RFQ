## 1.0 Background and Purpose

### 1.1	Background
Local Head Start programs prepare America’s most vulnerable young children, ages birth to 5, to succeed in school and in life. About 1,600 agencies across the country receive grant funding and oversight from the [Office of Head Start (OHS)](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/about-us/article/about-office-head-start) to operate local Head Start programs, which enroll about 1 million children each year. OHS ensures that grantees meet [federal standards](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/policy/45-cfr-chap-xiii) for operating safe and effective programs. 

Head Start was launched as a federal pilot program in 1965 and has a powerful track record of innovation [and effectiveness](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/story) in early childhood education. More than 37 million Americans have attended Head Start programs. 

Head Start programs deliver comprehensive services to children and families in core areas of early learning, health, and family well-being. Most programs operate in centers, though services can also be offered in family child care homes, an individual family's home, or locally designed options, such as inside a homeless shelter.

To help grantees deliver high-quality services, OHS is legislatively mandated and funded to provide a training and technical assistance (TTA) system. TTA activities are planned and delivered at the national, regional and grantee levels; each level has a distinct function designed to complement the others. For a detailed explanation of how the TTA system operates, see [this page.](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/assistance) 

Examples of TTA include, but are not limited to, the following: 

* Individual TTA: In-person or virtual meetings where a single grantee and TTA provider address a specific issue, such as helping a staff person set up a coaching program to support teachers and improve the quality of instruction. The TTA objective could be completed in a single session or extend over several engagements. 

* Group TTA: In-person, virtual sessions or a combination where several grantees address a common issue, such as serving the needs of families affected by opioid misuse. 

### 1.2	Problems OHS is looking to address 

As noted above, TTA activities are planned and delivered at the federal, regional and local grantee levels. However, while there is multiple points of data capture, there is no centralized data system for TTA leaders in Central Office and 12 Regions, their contractors, or grantees to share information about myriad TTA needs, activities or outcomes. Various streams of TTA data are: 

1. housed in a comprehensive Central Office system that was not designed for TTA task management; 
2. housed in a limited legacy system that won’t meet federal IT standards; 
3. held in stand-alone systems managed by regional contractors; and 
4. held in non-standardized documents held by individuals at various levels of the system. 

These information silos make it difficult for OHS TTA leaders to:

* ensure that TTA is data-driven, responsive to grantee needs and effective; and
* provide real-time oversight and quality assurance of the 12 regional TTA  contracts and 4 national TTA cooperative agreements.

#### Narrative and Anecdotal Information 

Regional TTA contractors must complete TTA Activity Reports, which contain abundant narrative data. Text-heavy narrative data can be helpful but it is hard to compare or track over time. People may also overlook the value of narrative data or choose other sources, such as anecdotal information, because trying to decipher a lot of text is overwhelming and frustrating. 

#### Disconnected Systems

TTA requests, reports and other data are housed in disparate systems that often weren’t built for managing comprehensive TTA tasks. Some are OHS-controlled, others are independent. Extracting and comparing data across these systems is difficult and time-consuming. There is a lack of consistency in solutions and systems at all levels (Central Office, Regional Offices, TTA contractors, states, and grantees).  

#### Data Access

Different systems require different credentials and have restricted access for different users, which don’t always reflect user needs. Existing data can be difficult to access. 

#### Data Inconsistency

Across TTA Activity Reports, email TTA summaries and official correspondence, people may use inconsistent terms to describe issues they are working on. Different TTA contracts may also adapt federal forms and gather differently labeled information, making it harder to collapse information and identify trends.

#### Data Usability
TTA Activity Reports are rich in information but are not formatted to summarize meaningful information. Information is also contained in uploaded attachments that aren’t searchable.

It is also difficult to organize and compare meaningful grant-level TTA data across grantees, or to track an individual grantee’s TTA history because grant numbers change when a grantee receives new funding. 

#### Incomplete View of TTA Activities

While national TTA centers and regional TTA contracts offer many forms of TTA, grantees also purchase TTA services directly from many vendors. Grantees receive 50% of the federal TTA appropriation for this use, but their TTA purchases are not easily analyzable at the regional or national level for coordinated TTA planning. This creates a further blind spot in understanding grantee needs and trends, and in ensuring that national and regional TTA providers fully understand grantee needs. 

#### *NOTE:* OHS acknowledges that not all of these problems can be addressed in the scope and period of performance of this task order. This information is provided so that the contractor is aware of the context of the work being done as the OHS Product Owner prioritizes the modular software development activities of the contractor team.

## 2.0 Scope

### Description of Work to be Performed

OHS seeks agile software development services. The services to be provided will include all aspects of the software development process, including initial planning, design, software development and coding, prototyping, documentation, testing, and configuration.

OHS intends that the software delivered under this task order will be committed to the public domain. The Contractor will have to obtain OHS permission before developing software under this task order that incorporates any software that is not free and open source. The Contractor must post all developed code to a GitHub repository designated by OHS. 

This software development project will use agile development principles, with robust documentation, human-centered design, and an extensible infrastructure. OHS expects that the development process will be collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent communication between OHS and the Contractor. 

The contractor team will be incrementally building a comprehensive TTA Data Platform (TTADP) that collects information from the entire TTA process and provides real-time, accessible information on TTA needs and activities. The initial phases of the development process will focus on reporting on the TTA Activities that are being delivered by TTA contractors and used by various groups within the Head Start system for management and ongoing decision making. 

By aggregating information around key data questions while meeting the needs of users inputting and reviewing the TTA data, the TTADP will greatly improve oversight, so leaders can ensure that TTA is responsive to grantee needs, meeting expectations for continuous quality improvement, and producing desired outcomes.

OHS has designated an empowered Product Owner for this project. OHS Product Owner will set direction, make prioritization choices to build a product roadmap, consider and address the business needs of OHS, and support the other members of the development team. The Contractor will assist OHS with product management and facilitation.

OHS, not the Contractor, will be responsible for the hosting of the deployed TTADP and obtaining any necessary Authority to Operate (ATO). OHS will also determine what security controls are required and whether they have been satisfied. OHS expects to provide those security controls to the Contractor as either acceptance criteria or separate user stories. The Contractor is expected to use best practices for security and compliance in writing, testing, and delivering code.

OHS intends to deploy the new TTADP as soon as the software has been sufficiently developed to provide the minimal viable functionality required to support an acceptable level of OHS’s fundamental TTA operations.

### 2.1	Product Vision
The OHS team has established the following as the overall vision statement for the TTADP. All prioritization decisions by the Product Owner will take this vision into consideration over the course of task order performance: 

**_To better serve children and families in Head Start programs, the TTA Data Platform will help staff at all levels make data-informed decisions that continuously improve Head Start services._**

### 2.2	Anticipated Period of Performance, Budget, and Ceiling Price

Vendors are expected to propose assuming a budget of $1.5M for the base year and $1.5M for each of the two option years. The not-to-exceed-ceiling on this contract over the course of three years will be $8M (not inclusive of Government’s use of FAR 52.217-8, if needed). The ceiling price is set higher than the budget amount to allow for the government to add funding in case the vendor team should need to add resources to meet the priorities set by the government’s Product Owner.

## 3.0 Objectives

### 3.1	MVP and Epic Stories

The MVP and Epic Stories set forth below will be the starting point for the development of software to be provided under this task order. These preliminary stories are provided only for illustrative purposes, and do not comprise the full scope or detail of the project. OHS expects that the Contractor will work closely with the Product Owner to perform regular user research and usability testing and to develop and prioritize a full gamut of user stories as the project progresses.

#### TTA Data Product MVP

The MVP is a part, but not the full realization, of the product vision. If the Product Vision is the manifestation of a fully decorated, multi-layered cake, then the MVP is a single layer of the cake. It is a single layer of the cake, and only part of the larger vision.

REMINDER TO PULL IN CAKE ILLUSTRATION

An MVP focused on Regional Office Program Specialists (PS) is an opportunity to digitize the TTA request process. The current state of TTA data does not capture information in a single location with enough relevant details to efficiently support PS users in their roles.

PS users will be able to initiate TTA Requests and track their status through completion which combines TTA Activity Summaries, Next Steps, and Task Completion. This system will allow PS users to view TTA over time, for specific grantees and groups of grantees, and across specific topic areas. In addition, the PS users will be able to track progress over time and may connect other dashboard/management systems via API access. For more information, see our [MVP slide deck.](need this from Robert)

As a Regional Office (federal) TTA staff member, I would like to have a clear view of all TTA activities from request through completion so that I can know if activities are complete and meeting objectives.

#### User Stories
Individual user stories may be modified, added, retracted, or reprioritized by OHS at any time, and OHS expects that the user stories will be continuously refined during the development process. 

### 3.2 List of Deliverables with Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)

The following chart sets forth the performance standards and quality levels the code and documentation provided by the Contractor must meet, and the methods OHS will use to assess the standard and quality levels of that code and documentation.

| Deliverable | Performance Standard(s) | Acceptable Quality Level | Method of Assessment |

| User Research | Usability testing and other user research methods must be conducted at regular intervals throughout the development process (not just at the beginning or end). | Research plans and artifacts from usability testing and/or other research methods with end users are available at the end of every applicable sprint, in accordance with the contractor’s research plan. | OFA will manually evaluate the artifacts based on a research plan provided by the contractor at the end of the second sprint and every applicable sprint thereafter. |

The government will use the (QASP) to monitor the quality of the Contractor’s performance. This oversight will help the government ensure that contractor performance reaches required levels throughout the contract term. The QASP provides the government with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or deficient performance and provides the basis for performance ratings in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). The QASP may be updated by modification to the contract. The QASP provides the basis for performing and controlling the project’s activities in accordance with the contract.

## 4.0 Contract Place of Performance and Contract Type
The Contractor may choose the location(s) from which to perform the required software development services. 

The government intends to award a time and material (T&M) type contract. All rates shall be fully burdened and T&M rates are fixed at the time of award. The offeror must specify whether the fixed hourly rate for each labor category applies to labor performed by— (1) The offeror; (2) Subcontractors; and/or (3) Divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates or the offeror under a common control.

The contractor shall understand that neither the funded ceiling on T&M CLINs, nor the hours on the T&M CLINs, is a guarantee to the contractor. The Government will utilize the hours and funding required to meet the Government’s need.

## 5.0 Operating Constraints (Non-functional Requirements)

### 5.1	Environment
The System will be deployed to cloud.gov infrastructure provided by OHS. Deployments are automated via continuous integration/continuous deployment. Contractor is required to maintain deployment scripts and configurations as changes are required. OHS will provide the necessary cloud.gov configuration information to the Contractor.

The system is composed of three primary parts: a database, a backend API application, and a frontend web application. All technology choices must work seamlessly with cloud.gov hosting. Data files are written using either JSON or YAML, depending on who is expected to edit them. (e.g., data files that OHS may edit directly are written in YAML).

The backend API application should use technologies such as:

_ A modern, open-source friendly language such as Ruby or Javascript, on the most recent version, or most recent LTS version, if applicable.

_ An open-source framework such as Rails or Express, on the most recent version or most recent LTS version, if applicable.

_ The frontend web application should use technologies such as:

GSA Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR): TBD at time of award 
OHS Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR): TBD at time of award

The government will notify the contractor if a change occurs to either the CO or COR. Specifically for the COR, the contractor will receive a copy of the “COR Delegation of Authority” assignment letter when a COR is assigned, and the contractor will also receive a letter rescinding the COR’s delegation when appropriate.

### 6.2 Authorities and Delegations

#### 6.2.1 
The TTS Office of Acquisition (OA)  is the only organization authorized to enter into or terminate this agreement, modify any term or condition of this agreement, waive any requirement of this agreement, or accept nonconforming work.

#### 6.2.2 
The Contracting Officer will designate a Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) at the time of award. The COR will be responsible for technical monitoring of the contractor's performance and deliverables. The COR will be appointed in writing, and a copy of the appointment will be furnished to the Contractor. Changes to this delegation will be made by written changes to the existing appointment or by issuance of a new appointment.

#### 6.2.3 
The COR is not authorized to perform, formally or informally, any of the following actions:

* Promise, award, agree to award, or execute any agreement, modification, or notice of intent that changes or may change this contract;

* Waive or agree to modification of the delivery schedule;

* Make any final decision on any contract matters subject to the disputes Clause;

* Terminate, for any reason, the Contractor's right to proceed;

* Obligate in any way, the payment of money by the Government

The Contractor shall comply with the written or oral direction of the Contracting Officer or authorized representative(s) acting within the scope and authority of the appointment memorandum. The Contractor need not proceed with direction that it considers to have been issued without proper authority. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing, with as much detail as possible, when the COR has taken an action or has issued direction (written or oral) that the Contractor considers to exceed the COR’s appointment, within 3 days of the occurrence. 

Unless otherwise provided in this agreement, the Contractor assumes all costs, risks, liabilities, and consequences of performing any work it is directed to perform that falls within any of the categories defined in paragraph 7.2.3. prior to receipt of the Contracting Officer’s response issued under paragraph 7.2.4 of this clause.

#### 6.2.4 

The Contracting Officer shall respond in writing within 30 days to any notice made under paragraph 8.2.3 of this clause. A failure of the parties to agree upon the nature of a direction, or upon the agreement action to be taken with respect thereto, shall be subject to the provisions of FAR 52.217-4(d) - Disputes.

### 6.3 Contractor Administration 
The contractor must provide the name of the individual responsible for centralized contract administration in support of all work performed under this order.  This individual, at a minimum, will serve as the point of contact for contractual issues, invoices, and the contractor representative for annual performance reviews (see section 6.5).

The information, inclusive of the name of the point of contact, email, and phone number, shall be uploaded through the ITSS Collaboration tool.

### 6.4 Post Award Orientation Conference

The government's team (CO, COR, and Product Owner) will hold a kickoff meeting (or post-award conference) with the selected contractor within 10 calendar days of the acquisition award. This kickoff will include the selected contractor’s team and other relevant government staff to review and clarify the project’s objectives, expectations from the government, and address any questions the selected contractor may have.

### 6.5 Contractor Performance

In accordance with FAR 8.406-7 and FAR 42.1502(c), past performance evaluations shall be prepared at least annually and at the time the work under the order is completed (to include options) when an order, individually, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. These evaluations are generally for the entity, division, or unit that performed the contract or order. 

(1) Evaluating Contractor Performance: The General Services Administration is using the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) module as the secure, confidential, information management tool to facilitate the performance evaluation process. CPARS enables a comprehensive evaluation by capturing comments from both TTS and the contractor. The website for CPARS is http://www.cpars.gov Completed CPARS evaluations are sent to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) which may then be used by Federal acquisition community for use in making source selection decisions. PPIRS assists acquisition officials by serving as the single source for contractor past performance data.

(2) CPARS Registration: Each award requiring an evaluation must be registered in CPARS. The awardee will receive several automated emails. Within thirty days of award, the contractor will receive an email that contains user account information, as well as the applicable contract and order number(s) assigned. The contractor will be granted one user account to access all evaluations.

(3) Contractor CPARS Training: The contractor may sign up for CPARS training. A schedule of classes will be posted to the CPARS training site (http://www.cpars.gov/allapps/cpcbtdlf.htm ) and updated as needed.

(4) Contractor Representative (CR) Role: All evaluations will be sent to the contractor Representative (CR) named on your award. The CR will be able to access CPARS to review and comment on the evaluation. If your CR is not already in the CPARS system, the contracting officer will request the name and email address of the person that will be responsible for the CR role on your award.

Once an evaluation is ready to be released the CR will receive an email alerting them the evaluation is ready for their review and comment. The email will indicate the time frame the CR has to respond to the evaluation; however, the CR may return the evaluation earlier than this date.

TTS shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer (i.e., contracting director) to consider any disagreement between TTS and the contractor regarding TTS’s evaluation of the contractor. Based on the review, the individual at a level above the contracting officer will issue the ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation.
Copies of the evaluations, contractor responses, and review comments, if any, will be retained as part of the contract file.

The similar experience references to one or more source code samples must be either links to Git repositories (either credentialed or public) or to equivalent version-controlled repositories that provide the evaluation team with the full revision history for all files. If a contractor submits a link to a private Git repository hosted with GitHub, the government will provide the contractor with one or more GitHub user identities by email, and the contractor will be expected to promptly provide the identified user(s) with access to the private Git repository.

The source code samples should be for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project contemplated here. The source code must have been developed by either (i) the contractor itself, (ii) a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this RFQ, or (iii) an individual that is being proposed as Key Personnel for this project. The government would prefer that the source code samples have been for recent projects involving teams of approximately four to seven full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel.

If the references to source code samples provided do not include associated references to user research plans and design artifacts demonstrating how ongoing user research was incorporated into the project, then the contractor must submit a user research plan and design artifacts relating to at least one (1) of the source code samples provided.

#### Phase 2 - Verbal Interviews

##### General Information 
*Format.* After review of Phase 1 –  Technical Submissions, the government will invite all contractors with a rating of “Some Confidence” or “High Confidence” to Phase 2 - Verbal Interview. Each contractor will be scheduled for a 60-minute interview with the evaluation team so they can ask questions based on contractor’s technical submission. Contractors should also introduce their team members who will be part of the support team. Lastly, the evaluation team will ask questions in regards to their expertise relative to the project.

*Location.* The interview sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The government will coordinate and set up the virtual meeting space accordingly (by providing dial-in or links).

*Date and Time.* The government will schedule the date and time of the interviews with each contractor after the RFQ closing date and receipt of “Some Confidence” or “High Confidence” quote submissions. The government reserves the right to reschedule any contractor’s interview date at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

Each interview will include an unstructured question and answer session, during which contractors will be asked questions about the technical aspects of their quote and their approach to software development. The government expects these interviews will assist in assessing the technical abilities of the proposed development team and to better understand the proposed technical approach described in the contractor’s written submission. All of the contractor’s proposed Key Personnel must participate in the interview.

The Introductions phase of each interview will last no more than 5 minutes, during which the contractor and government interview team members will introduce themselves.

The Open Technical Session of each interview will last no more than 45 minutes, during which the Contractor interview team will respond to the government’s questions related to the technical aspects of the contractor’s quote. Contractors will NOT be able to use or present any slides, graphs, charts, or other written presentation materials, including handouts. There will be no follow-up session for further questions after this part of the interview.

The Closing Remarks phase of each interview will no more than 5 minutes, during which the contractor may make a short presentation summarizing the contractor’s responses to the government’s questions.

The interview associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR Part 15. Statements made during an interview will not become part of the contract. The government will not determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, nor solicit or allow revised quotes. 

**Once interviews are complete, each contractor will be assigned a confidence rating.**

#### Phase 3 - Price Submissions

The government expects that the labor categories and staffing levels set forth by the contractor in the Excel workbook will be consistent with the contractor’s staffing plan and with their GSA Schedule contract pricing.

The Contractor will be compensated at fully loaded hourly rates. The evaluation team intends to evaluate quotes without discussions with contractors, and therefore the contractor’s initial quote should contain the contractor’s best terms.

In an effort to receive the highest quality solution at the lowest possible price, the government requires discounts on all materials and services offered by contractors for this requirement in order to be considered for award. Contractors are encouraged to offer discounts below schedule contract rates, whichever is applicable. When discounts are offered, quotations must clearly identify the contract rate, the discount rate, and the percentage discount for each item or labor rate being discounted.

The contractor must provide a copy of their GSA Price Lists for all three (3) years for verification of pricing. If submitting a quote as a CTA, each member must submit their schedule pricing for each SIN they are eligible to perform under. If price discounts are not provided on the GSA price list, then the contractor will be deemed unacceptable.
 
For contractors that do not have out-year pricing, your task order pricing may be escalated at the same percentage of your GSA multiple award schedule (MAS) contract provided you submit a copy of a valid executed modification of your GSA MAS schedule to the CO.

The government is expecting price reductions for every rate proposed for the entire period(s) of performance. Prices will be verified to ensure they do not exceed the contractor's Schedule contract price. Prices will be evaluated with regard to whether discounted rates are offered or not. Quotes proposing labor rates that exceed those established in the contractor’s BPA contract will not be considered for award. 

Contractors will submit an Excel-based spreadsheet detailing the labor categories, contract rates, discount rates and discount percentages. This submission must not be submitted in PDF format. 

Contractors must complete the sections in BLUE of the attached the Pricing Sheet. The Pricing Sheet attached to this solicitation must be completed and returned in Excel format with formulae intact. Submission of any other price sheet will constitute a non-responsive quote. 

### 7.3 Basis of Award and Evaluation Factors

The government will evaluate the submitted quotes against the criteria set forth below and then make an award based on best value using tradeoffs. The government intends to utilize a phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be considered for award, contractors must successfully pass through each phase.

The government will award a task order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible contractor whose quote conforms to the RFQ that represents the best value to the government, price and the other criteria specified below. Contractors are advised that the non-price evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price. As non-price ratings become closer, price will become more important. 

#### Phase 1 –  Technical Submission
Criteria 1:  Technical Approach
Criteria 2:  Staffing Plan
Criteria 3:  Similar Experience
#### Phase 2 - Criteria 4: Verbal interview
#### Phase 3 - Price Submission

Contractors must meet all requirements in Phase 1 and will be assigned a confidence rating. After the initial Phase 1 confidence assignment, contractors with a ranking of “Some Confidence” or “High Confidence” will be invited for Phase 2 - Verbal Interview. 

Quotes that have failed to meet the criteria established in Phase 1 will no longer be considered for award. Contractors that pass Phase 2 with a “Some Confidence” or “High Confidence” will be evaluated based on their price submission. 

The government will evaluate price quotes for award purposes by evaluating the hourly rate for each labor category and the overall discount provided off the contractor’s GSA schedule pricing. This will include evaluating estimated hours submitted by the contractor for the purpose of considering the estimated total cost to the government. The government may determine that a quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options under FAR 52.217-8 will be accomplished by using the prices offered for the last option period to determine the price for a 6-month option period, which will be added to the base and other option years to arrive at the total price. Evaluation of options will not obligate the government to exercise the option(s).

The government also reserves the right to make no award.

**_NOTE: The government anticipates selecting an awardee based upon initial quotes received; therefore, contractors are cautioned to submit their best price and technical quotes in the initial submission._**

#### Evaluation:

##### Technical Approach
In evaluating a contractor’s technical approach, the government will consider (a) the quality of the contractor’s plans to provide the open source, agile development services required, including user research and design, (b) the extent of the contractor’s understanding of the details of the project requirements, and (c) the extent to which the contractor has identified potential obstacles to efficient development, and has proposed realistic approaches to overcome those potential obstacles.

##### Staffing Plan
In evaluating a contractor’s staffing plan, the government will consider (a) the skills and experience of the Key Personnel and other individuals that the contractor plans to use to provide the required services, (b) the mix of labor categories that will comprise the contractor’s proposed development team, and (c) the contractor’s proposed number of hours of services to be provided by each member of the contractor’s proposed development team.

##### Similar Experience
In evaluating a contractor’s similar experience, the government will consider the extent to which the contractor has recently provided software development services for projects that are similar in size, scope, and complexity to the project described in this RFQ, and the quality of those services. In evaluating the quality of those services, the evaluation team will consider, among other things, the revision history for all files in the source code samples provided. The government will also consider the user research and design-related artifacts that were associated with the source code samples provided or submitted separately. In considering a contractor’s similar experience, the government may also consider information from any other source, including contractor’s prior customers and public websites.

##### Price
In evaluating a contractor’s price, the government will consider the total of the contractor’s estimated costs for the development services, and travel expenses proposed, for three years (a base year period plus two one-year option periods). Contractors will use this Excel workbook to submit pricing information.
