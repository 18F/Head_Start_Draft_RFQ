# 1.0 Background and Purpose

## 1.1	Background
Local Head Start programs prepare America’s most vulnerable young children, ages birth to 5, to succeed in school and in life. About 1,600 agencies across the country receive grant funding and oversight from the [Office of Head Start (OHS)](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/about-us/article/about-office-head-start) to operate local Head Start programs, which enroll about 1 million children each year. OHS ensures that grantees meet [federal standards](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/policy/45-cfr-chap-xiii) for operating safe and effective programs. 

Head Start was launched as a federal pilot program in 1965 and has a powerful track record of innovation [and effectiveness](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/story) in early childhood education. More than 37 million Americans have attended Head Start programs. 

Head Start programs deliver comprehensive services to children and families in core areas of early learning, health, and family well-being. Most programs operate in centers, though services can also be offered in family child care homes, an individual family's home, or locally designed options, such as inside a homeless shelter.

To help grantees deliver high-quality services, OHS is legislatively mandated and funded to provide a training and technical assistance (TTA) system. TTA activities are planned and delivered at the national, regional and grantee levels; each level has a distinct function designed to complement the others. For a detailed explanation of how the TTA system operates, see [this page.](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ohs/assistance) 

Examples of TTA include, but are not limited to, the following: 

* Individual TTA: In-person or virtual meetings where a single grantee and TTA provider address a specific issue, such as helping a staff person set up a coaching program to support teachers and improve the quality of instruction. The TTA objective could be completed in a single session or extend over several engagements. 

* Group TTA: In-person, virtual sessions or a combination where several grantees address a common issue, such as serving the needs of families affected by opioid misuse. 

## 1.2	Problems OHS is looking to address 

As noted above, TTA activities are planned and delivered at the federal, regional and local grantee levels. However, while there is multiple points of data capture, there is no centralized data system for TTA leaders in Central Office and 12 Regions, their contractors, or grantees to share information about myriad TTA needs, activities or outcomes. Various streams of TTA data are: 

1. housed in a comprehensive Central Office system that was not designed for TTA task management; 
2. housed in a limited legacy system that won’t meet federal IT standards; 
3. held in stand-alone systems managed by regional contractors; and 
4. held in non-standardized documents held by individuals at various levels of the system. 

These information silos make it difficult for OHS TTA leaders to:

* ensure that TTA is data-driven, responsive to grantee needs and effective; and
* provide real-time oversight and quality assurance of the 12 regional TTA  contracts and 4 national TTA cooperative agreements.

### Narrative and Anecdotal Information 

Regional TTA contractors must complete TTA Activity Reports, which contain abundant narrative data. Text-heavy narrative data can be helpful but it is hard to compare or track over time. People may also overlook the value of narrative data or choose other sources, such as anecdotal information, because trying to decipher a lot of text is overwhelming and frustrating. 

### Disconnected Systems

TTA requests, reports and other data are housed in disparate systems that often weren’t built for managing comprehensive TTA tasks. Some are OHS-controlled, others are independent. Extracting and comparing data across these systems is difficult and time-consuming. There is a lack of consistency in solutions and systems at all levels (Central Office, Regional Offices, TTA contractors, states, and grantees).  

### Data Access

Different systems require different credentials and have restricted access for different users, which don’t always reflect user needs. Existing data can be difficult to access. 

### Data Inconsistency

Across TTA Activity Reports, email TTA summaries and official correspondence, people may use inconsistent terms to describe issues they are working on. Different TTA contracts may also adapt federal forms and gather differently labeled information, making it harder to collapse information and identify trends.

### Data Usability
TTA Activity Reports are rich in information but are not formatted to summarize meaningful information. Information is also contained in uploaded attachments that aren’t searchable.

It is also difficult to organize and compare meaningful grant-level TTA data across grantees, or to track an individual grantee’s TTA history because grant numbers change when a grantee receives new funding. 

### Incomplete View of TTA Activities

While national TTA centers and regional TTA contracts offer many forms of TTA, grantees also purchase TTA services directly from many vendors. Grantees receive 50% of the federal TTA appropriation for this use, but their TTA purchases are not easily analyzable at the regional or national level for coordinated TTA planning. This creates a further blind spot in understanding grantee needs and trends, and in ensuring that national and regional TTA providers fully understand grantee needs. 

### *NOTE:* OHS acknowledges that not all of these problems can be addressed in the scope and period of performance of this task order. This information is provided so that the contractor is aware of the context of the work being done as the OHS Product Owner prioritizes the modular software development activities of the contractor team.
